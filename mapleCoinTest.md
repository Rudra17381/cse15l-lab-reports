It is a cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain technology based on decentralized consensus, making it safer than every physical currency currently in existence. This revolutionary technology is the future of currencies; Be a fundamental part of this future by participating in the Maple Coin Network today

## What is a cryptocurrency? Why use it?
---
Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is not controlled by any single entity such as a government or a bank. It roams free of every border and is built upon and maintained by clever mathematical ideas and algorithms, making it practically impossible and theoretically implausible to break. It is free of the risk of any corruption, which is a possibility in currencies governed by a single body like a government and is instead controlled by the people using it, making it the most secure form of currency.

A cryptocurrency gives its users the peace of mind of their money being safe as there is no being behind it; it's all just mathematics! It also provides an easy outlet for people to invest in and contribute to the growth of this revolutionary technology. Cryptocurrencies are the people's currencies, and hence they have a bright future ahead of them where they might soon be replacing physical currencies forever and for good.

Maple Coin is a breath of fresh air in the world of cryptocurrencies. It is committed to using its robust infrastructure to facilitate and promote the safe and secure exchange of money between individuals and entities. It is a contribution to the growth of cryptocurrencies and will get just better with time.
